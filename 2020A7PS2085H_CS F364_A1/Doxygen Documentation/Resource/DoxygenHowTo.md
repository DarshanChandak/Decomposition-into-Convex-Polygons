## Objective: 
Decomposing any arbitrary polygon into convex polygon is a well-studied problem. In this
assignment you are required to implement the algorithm described in the following paper:

[1] Fernández, J., Cánovas, L., & Pelegrın, B. (2000). Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into ́
convex polygons. European Journal of Operational Research, 12(2), 330-342.
